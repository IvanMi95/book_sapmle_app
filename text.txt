When a method gets called on the class itself, as in the case of new, it’s
called a class method. The result of calling new on a class is an object of
that class, also called an instance of the class. A method called on an
instance, such as length, is called an instance method.

• Most migrations (including all the ones in this tutorial) are
reversible, which means we can “migrate down” and undo them with
a single command, called db:rollback:
$ rails db:rollback

If for any reason something went wrong, you can always reset the database
as follows:
• Quit the console.
• Run $ rm -f development.sqlite3 at the command line to remove
the database. (We’ll learn a more elegant method for doing this in
Chapter 7.)
• Rerun the migrations using $ rails db:migrate.
• Restart the console.
